Game Overview

  Frog Hop
- Game Summary
  In Frog Hop, you play as a frog hopping along a river on lilypads. Hop across the lily pads in order to gain points,       collect food, and reach stars to advance to the next level. As the levels increase, the rewards double but the levels      are more challenging with less lily pads to hop on. Help the frog navigate through the water and get a new high score!
- Core Gameplay Loop
  The player controls the frog using arrow keys to hop between lilypads. Player is given 3 lives and must hop around in      attempt to collect food for bonus points and reach the star to advance to the next level. As the levels increase, there    will be less lily pads and less food. Missing a lily pad or jumping into the water will cause the player to lose a life.   As soon as all 3 lives are gone, the game is over.
